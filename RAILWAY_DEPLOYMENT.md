# Railway.com Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying the Latvian Author Website to Railway.com, a modern cloud platform that provides automatic deployments from Git repositories.

## Prerequisites

- Git repository with your code
- Railway.com account
- Basic understanding of environment variables

## Quick Start

1. **Connect Repository to Railway**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Start a New Project"
   - Connect your Git repository
   - Select the repository containing this code

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your project
   - Click on "Variables" tab
   - Add the required environment variables (see below)

3. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically deploy when you push to your main branch
   - Monitor deployment logs in the Railway dashboard

## Required Environment Variables

Set these variables in Railway's dashboard under the "Variables" section:

### Essential Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-string-here
```

### Email Configuration
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
```

### Admin Credentials
```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
```

### Database (Automatically provided by Railway)
Railway will automatically provide these when you add a PostgreSQL database:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
PGHOST=...
PGPORT=...
PGDATABASE=...
PGUSER=...
PGPASSWORD=...
```

## Database Setup

### Adding PostgreSQL Database

1. In Railway dashboard, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically create the database and provide connection variables
4. The application will automatically detect and use PostgreSQL in production

### Database Migration

The application automatically handles database migration:
- In development: Uses SQLite (`database.sqlite`)
- In production (Railway): Uses PostgreSQL
- Tables and indexes are created automatically on first startup
- Default admin user is created if none exists

## Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment

Railway automatically deploys when you:
1. Push to your main/master branch
2. The deployment process includes:
   - Building the Docker container
   - Installing dependencies
   - Running health checks
   - Starting the application

### Manual Deployment

You can also trigger manual deployments:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Deploy" button
3. Monitor deployment logs

## Health Checks

The application includes built-in health monitoring:
- **Health Endpoint**: `/api/health`
- **Railway Health Check**: Configured in `railway.toml`
- **Docker Health Check**: Built into Dockerfile

Test the health endpoint after deployment:
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "database": "connected",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## File Storage

### Static Files
- Static files are served from the `public/` directory
- Uploaded images are stored in the `uploads/` directory
- Both directories are included in the Docker container

### Persistent Storage
Railway provides ephemeral storage by default. For persistent file uploads:
1. Consider using Railway's Volume feature
2. Or integrate with cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive data to Git
- Use Railway's environment variables for all secrets
- Rotate secrets regularly

### HTTPS
- Railway automatically provides HTTPS
- The application is configured to work with HTTPS in production

### Database Security
- Railway PostgreSQL instances are secured by default
- Connection uses SSL in production
- Database credentials are automatically managed

## Monitoring and Logs

### Application Logs
View logs in Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click on your service
3. View "Logs" tab

### Error Tracking
The application includes comprehensive error logging:
- Request/response logging
- Database error handling
- Security event logging

### Performance Monitoring
Monitor application performance:
- Response times logged for slow requests (>5s)
- Database connection monitoring
- Memory and CPU usage in Railway dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Database Connection Errors**
```
Error: Connection refused
```
Solution: Ensure PostgreSQL service is running and environment variables are set

**2. Missing Environment Variables**
```
Error: SESSION_SECRET is required
```
Solution: Set all required environment variables in Railway dashboard

**3. File Upload Issues**
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'uploads/...'
```
Solution: Ensure uploads directory exists (handled automatically by deployment script)

**4. Health Check Failures**
```
Health check failed
```
Solution: Check application logs and ensure database is connected

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # In Railway dashboard, verify all required variables are set
   ```

2. **Review Deployment Logs**
   - Check Railway deployment logs for errors
   - Look for database connection issues
   - Verify all dependencies installed correctly

3. **Test Health Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
   ```

4. **Check Database Connection**
   - Verify PostgreSQL service is running
   - Check database connection variables
   - Review database initialization logs

## Scaling and Performance

### Automatic Scaling
Railway provides automatic scaling based on:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Request volume

### Performance Optimization
The application includes several optimizations:
- Gzip compression
- Static file caching
- Database connection pooling
- Request rate limiting

### Resource Limits
Monitor resource usage in Railway dashboard:
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Database connections
- Storage usage

## Backup and Recovery

### Database Backups
Railway automatically backs up PostgreSQL databases:
- Daily automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery available
- Manual backup triggers available

### File Backups
For uploaded files:
1. Consider implementing automated backups to cloud storage
2. Use Railway's Volume snapshots if using persistent volumes

## Cost Management

### Railway Pricing
- Free tier available for development
- Pay-as-you-use pricing for production
- Monitor usage in Railway dashboard

### Optimization Tips
- Use appropriate resource limits
- Monitor and optimize database queries
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Regular cleanup of unused files

npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Test Railway deployment configuration
npm run railway:test
```

### Deployment Workflow
```bash
# 1. Test locally
npm run test:all

# 2. Test Railway configuration
npm run railway:test

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# 4. Monitor deployment in Railway dashboard
```

### Environment Parity
- Use `.env` for local development
- Use Railway variables for production
- Keep environment configurations in sync

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domains
1. In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed
4. Railway handles SSL certificates automatically

### Multiple Environments
Set up staging and production environments:
1. Create separate Railway projects
2. Use different Git branches
3. Configure environment-specific variables

### CI/CD Integration
Railway integrates with:
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- Other CI/CD platforms

Example GitHub Action for additional testing:
```yaml
name: Deploy to Railway
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run railway:test
```
