# Railway Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues âœ…

The deployment issues have been resolved by:

1. **Downgraded Cheerio**: Changed from `^1.1.2` to `^1.0.0-rc.12` for Node.js 18 compatibility
2. **Removed problematic configurations**: Removed engine requirements that were forcing newer Node.js versions
3. **Regenerated package-lock.json**: Ensured all dependencies are compatible with Node.js 18.20.8

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment compatibility"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway**:
   - Railway will automatically detect the changes
   - The build should now succeed with Node.js 18.20.8
   - No additional configuration needed

## Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard:

### Required
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret`

### Optional (for email functionality)
- `EMAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host`
- `EMAIL_PORT=587`
- `EMAIL_USER=your-email@domain.com`
- `EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password`
- `EMAIL_FROM=your-email@domain.com`

## Health Check

After deployment, verify the application is working:
- Health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- Main site: `https://your-app.railway.app`
- Interesanti section: `https://your-app.railway.app/#interesanti`

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Ensure all files are committed** to git
4. **Contact Railway support** if issues persist

The application is now compatible with Railway's default Node.js 18.20.8 environment.
